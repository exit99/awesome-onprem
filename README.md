# awesome-onprem
A list of companies that use on-premise infrastructure heavily

# Why is this list?
I understand many people want to work on the latest and the greatest services by the big3 [AWS, GCP and Azure] cloud providers. However, I have found it more interesting in working on companies thats hosts their own data center and using internal tools, open source solution. May be I am biased because I am a SRE ðŸ˜‰. If you are like me on the same boat, please do contribute.
